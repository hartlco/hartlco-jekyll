It‘s company Christmas party time. This means, dressing up a little and drinking while it‘s cold outside. Everything could be worse. We even spent this evening at a traditional German Christmas market when it started snowing. Berlin in the winter also has its upsides.

### iPhone X
Finally! I got my iPhone X. I played with this phone a couple of times before, but now I have one for all for myself. The build quality feels amazing again. My Jetblack iPhone 7 felt great, but this X handles like it‘s made out of one block. I love it. So far there is not a single aspect I don‘t like. We don‘t talk about the control center placement here.

### Bitcoin
I remember back in 2011 when I first heard of Bitcoin. I liked the idea of an open and distributed currency for the internet. I installed the main Bitcoin App and even mined for a few days. After a while, I lost interest, didn’t want to be involved in trading and deleted everything. I was sure there is no future in it. And here we are in 2017...I‘m still not sure what to think about it. The environmental impacts are significant but still, the idea of a hard to regulate currency is still intriguing.

### Music - Warpaint
I listened to Warpaint almost exclusively this work. It works really well for me as background music. It’s comforting and relaxing.

Until next week!
