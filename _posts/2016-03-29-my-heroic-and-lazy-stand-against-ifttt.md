> It&#8217;s entirely IFTTT&#8217;s decision to drop support for Pinboard (along with a bunch of other sites). They are the ones who are going to flip the switch on working code on April 4, and they could just as easily flip the switch back on (or even write an IFTTT recipe that does it for them). Weigh their claims about Pinboard being a beloved service accordingly. 

Ich verwende IFTTT hauptsächlich um alle möglichen Sachen in Day One zu spiegeln. Hoffentlich kommt bald eine öffentliche Day One API, so dass ich nicht mehr auf IFTTT angewiesen bin.
