[Brent Simmons:](http://inessential.com/2014/09/29/omni)

>I love that I get to work on both Vesper and on Omni apps. Omni is one of the great Cocoa development companies, and they’ve grown slowly and steadily over many years. They write lovable productivity apps — not just great iOS apps but also great Mac apps. They’re generous to and respectful of their users, employees, and the local development community. Their values and ambitions align perfectly with mine.

At first I was a little shocked when I read this post; another great indie developer is leaving the fields. After I thought about it for a few seconds, it clicked. I imagine Omni to be a wonderful workplace, all their Apps are focused on solving problems in ways that are true to the platforms. The company supports the indie developer community and has it's roots deep inside Apple's and NeXT's history. In addition, Brent is able to keep on developing for [Vesper](http://vesperapp.co). Yes, I can see no downsides to this.
