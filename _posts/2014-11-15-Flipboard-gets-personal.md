By now this really is old news, but [Flipboard](https://about.flipboard.com) finally did receive a major update again. Since its launch, this App is one of my all-time-favorites and always had a spot on my homescreen. I use Flipboard for sites and topics which tend to have a high post volume, so I do not overload my RSS reader. Every time I want get an overview of the latest news or just want to read something, there is Flipboard with always new content. I'm really happy to see that the App is still in active development!
