And here we go for the second Weekly. I planned to write a lot more during the week for this but somehow only was able to capture a few notes. That’s fine. There is enough time to do it now.

### Gadgets - Hello Android
This week was the first time in over 5 since I have used an Android phone for more than 1 minute. I’m using a Moto G5 as my second phone now, just to get to know the operating system, the design language, and the usage patterns. I have to say Android got a LOT better over the last 60 months, who would have guessed. This phone costs around 150€ and it’s deeply impressive what it offers for this price. I still think a lot of choices Android makes are strange but that’s fine, everyone can choose.

### Development - Hello Android
Since the official announcement of Android Studio 3 with official Kotlin support, I got interested in learning a little bit of native Android development. I started with this short [Youtube tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRYPafLAYps&list=PL0dzCUj1L5JFWMoGYWyUSAUnR4PHIJaZY) from [Brian Voong](https://twitter.com/buildthatapp?lang=en) just to get to know the basics. I think he is also an iOS developer and therefore speaks a familiar language!
I have to say Android Studio is very powerful but…it’s just not a native Mac App. The App feels and looks different, especially how default key commands or modal windows are handled. On the other hand, you will get used to it. I’m looking forward building and submitting my first Android App.

### Music - Japandroids
On a recent episode of [Do By Friday](http://dobyfriday.com) [Alex](https://twitter.com/alexcox?lang=en) mentioned the band [Japandroids](https://www.last.fm/music/Japandroids) and I immediately fell in love with them. All their stuff on Apple Music was my tune for the week.

### Playing - Back to Rocket League
Yes, yes I was playing a lot of Destiny until the end of the last week. I hit the level cap and was improving my gear but then, a flip switched and I lost interested. I’ll defiantly check out the game again when the next content, hits but for now there is nothing to do in the game that’s interesting to me.

I started playing more Rocket League again this week, especially with the [big championship](https://www.rlcs.gg) happening this weekend.

### Watching
I just saw Murder on the Orient Express (2017). I liked it, beautiful pictures and I didn’t know the plot. Entertaining!

### Apps
The App I enjoyed this week the most was Ulysses again. After moving my diary to this App, I was able to get into a nice habit of writing a few lines in the morning. I hope it continues!

Until next week!
