> Content. Not clutter.  
Your web experience has never been this fast and efficient.  
uBlock is completely free and open-source.

Whilst on the subject of Ad-blocking: uBlock looks like a perfect alternative to the bigger players in the game. uBlock is completely free, open source and the project is supported by donations. The intentions of the companies behind the more well-known alternatives is often unclear, so Iâ€™m very happy to use uBlock instead.
