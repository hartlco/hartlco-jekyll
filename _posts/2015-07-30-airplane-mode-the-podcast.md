Dave Wiskus:

> We’ve always loved Behind the Music and iTunes Originals, and hearing our favorite artists tell stories on stage. Something about a view into the process makes the music feel like a more intimate experience. It seemed that, if we were going to try starting a band and making a record without a road map, perhaps we had an opportunity to give others a look into what we’re doing. 

This podcast follows the path of Dave Wiskus and Joe Cieplinski starting the indie rock band Airplane Mode. A really cool project and neat idea for a podcast. The first songs also sound promising!
