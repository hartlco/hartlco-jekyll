title: iOS 9 Concept Video
---

Every now and then a video pops up on Youtube demonstrating how the new version of iOS should look like.
Just a quote from the linked video: 

>“this video was made to show features and ideas that need to be on Apple's next iOS major update”. 

You can’t be serious if you think you can deliver a better work with just a wink of your hand than many visual- and interaction-designers working full time on iOS at Apple.
They work under many hard constraints like maintaining the best accessibility on the market and creating gorgeous yet highly usable designs which pleases almost everyone. Most people don’t want to change the color of every part of the operating system because the end result will definitely look worse. Features like closing all running Apps are bad for the whole user experience. 

There were some really great ideas demonstrated in similar videos([Swipe Selection by Daniel Hooper](http://youtu.be/RGQTaHGQ04Q) or [Concept Notification Center by Jan-Michael Cart](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SwmLdsHTUZE)), but they all focused on one idea.

Nothing is wrong with posting a video like this to bounce off ideas and show your skills but don't assume you are the next star designer and Apple was waiting for your ideas to implement.
