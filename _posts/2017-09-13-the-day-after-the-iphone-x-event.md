It‘s now 24 hours after the big iPhone keynote. Nothing that was revealed yesterday came as a big surprise, but still, it was one of my favorite keynotes in quite some time.
The whole keynote had a throw-back Steve Jobs theme that I really enjoyed.
All revealed products look like awesome upgrades to the product line. Even the iPhone 8, standing in the shadow of the X, will be appealing to a lot of people thanks to it‘s price, refreshed design and new features.

What I‘m planning to get? Probably a new Apple Watch 3 without LTE and an iPhone X!
