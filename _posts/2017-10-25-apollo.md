For more than two years now Iâ€™m an active reader on Reddit. I can post about all the subreddits I follow in a future post. Until now, [Narwhal](http://getnarwhal.com) was my Reddit App of choice. Yesterday I discovered [Apollo](https://apolloapp.io) through this nice article on [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/apollo-a-powerful-modern-reddit-client-for-ios/).

The App has all features you would expect from a Reddit client, but in addition feels extremely well made. All animations and interactions are super smooth. The whole design and experience feels 100% true to iOS. It really is a poster child of an App. The last time an App felt this true to the platform for me, was when Tweetie 1 was released!

Please, if you are interested in Reddit Apps, give this a try!
