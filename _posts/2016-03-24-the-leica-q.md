> The Q is small but substantial. Solid. It becomes an effortless all-day companion. Strapped across my chest, it was banged sideways against rocks, motorcycles, stone walls, metal water bottles, farmers, cats. It captured everything thrown at it and into it. And while I was suspicious of the value of the camera at first, these past six months have made it clear that this machine has serious legs. I now understand the limitations of this photographic instrument, of which there are few. And I trust and enjoy it more than any other camera Iâ€™ve owned.
    
> Yes, even more than my iPhone. 

Bei diesem Bericht zur Leica Q kommt doch &#8222;Camera lust&#8220; bei mir auf.
