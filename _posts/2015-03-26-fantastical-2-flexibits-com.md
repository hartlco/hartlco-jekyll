>The calendar app you won't be able to live without.

A brand new version of Fantastical launched yesterday. It includes a whole lot of features and extends the menu bar application, we are all used to, with complete standalone calendar App. I'm not a heavy calendar user, but if I use one, it's Fantastical.
