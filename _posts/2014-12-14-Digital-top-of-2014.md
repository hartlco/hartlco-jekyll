title: Digital Top of 2014

2014 is almost over, this means it's time to seek out my digital favourites of the year.

## Mobile App: [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/)
One of my most used Apps on the iPhone. Smart Speed and Voice Boost are incredible features and improve the daily listening experience.

## Desktop App: [Spillo](http://bananafishsoftware.com/products/spillo/)
I finally made the switch to using [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in) for my bookmarks and Spillo is an excellent native Mac Client.  

## Album: [Angus & Julia - Stone Angus & Julia Stone](http://www.angusandjuliastone.com/)
This is a nice laid-back indie folk LP. I highly recommend it but I can't write much about music because it's such a highly subjective category.

## Movie: [The Wolf Of Wall Street](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-wolf-of-wall-street/id774084884?uo=4&at=11lqGj)
I saw this movie in the beginning of the year but I still think about this weird piece of art from time to time. I still haven't seen some of the big movies from this year but The Wolf Of Wall Street is a special one.

## Game: [Monument Valley](http://www.monumentvalleygame.com/)
A beautiful game, every level is absolute stunning. Make sure to also play the just released extension.

## Podcast: [Serial](http://serialpodcast.org/)
2014 was a great year for Podcasts. Myke Hurley went indie and started together with Stephen Hakett the great [Relay podcast network](http://www.relay.fm/). But my single favourite Podcast has been Serial. Sarah Koenig and the This American Life crew tried something new with the medium and succeeded. I'm totally addicted.
