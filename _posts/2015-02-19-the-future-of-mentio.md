I released [Mentio](http://mentioapp.com) over a year ago. It was the first time something I built got publicly reviewed. Every day dozens of people, me included, use it to save some kind of media to consume later. Compared to other Apps, everything is at a tiny, tiny scale but I'm still a bit proud of it. The market for paid Apps isn't easy, especially with such a niche App like Mentio. 

I was thinking about the future for Mentio for a long time. At first I planned to move on with a freemium model. I would need to rethink all features of the App, what should be free, what will be paid? What should I do with the old userbase? What features can I add to increase the incentive of paying for the App? I quickly realized I will not have much time to do all of this. I need to finish  my thesis, my lovely girlfriend and I plan to move to Berlin and hopefully I'll find a nice job. On the other hand, I don't want to abandon the App completely until I have time for it again. I'm going to add new features to Mentio but I will simplify the business side: As of yesterday the App is free!

I'm almost done implementing all changes for the planned 2.0 release. It will include an archive for completed items, will update all items in the background and notify you if a price drop occurs. The release is planned for mid March.

After version 2.0 has shipped I'm going to push the whole App to this [repository](https://github.com/mhaddl/mentio) on Github. Everyone interested can have a look, and suggest changes to the code or the design by pull request. I hope to keep the project alive this way.

There is something to announce today: You can participate in the beta via Testflight. Just send me your Apple Id to mentio@mhaddl.me and I will invite you if you are interested in joining.
