The latest Apple rumors indicate that the launch of the HomePod is coming closer. Over the time span from the announcement at WWDC 2017 until now, I completely lost interest in this product. This feeling is not only toward the HomePod itself but all tubular speaker voice assistants. I consider myself an early adopter but this product category is just not for me.

### Trackpad
I had to switch my working setup again, as a light daily wrist pain emerged every evening. To prevent this in the past, I regularly switched back and forth from using the MacBook keyboard and trackpad to extended keyboard and a Logitech mouse. This no longer did the trick and I introduced a third variation to the mix.: the Magic Keyboard and the Apple Trackpad. So far I really like this setup as it further reduces the movement my wrists have to make. The pain vanished almost from one day to the other!

### Decluttering
This weekend we assembled our new wardrobe. I used this opportunity to further declutter and get rid of loads of stuff.  I constantly try to get rid of no longer needed belongings but I always hesitated to get rid of one unnecessary type of things: Old tech product boxes. This changed this weekended and I kicked out many old boxes for things Iâ€™m not planning to sell: Boxes for headphones, Apple Watch, wireless routerâ€¦
This felt good and made some space in our cupboard!
