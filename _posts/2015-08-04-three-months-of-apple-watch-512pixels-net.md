Stephen Hackett:

> Apple Watch is much more about want than need. I can’t judge that for anyone but me, but it is something to think about. Apple Watch probably isn’t going to change your life, but it will make it better in a bunch of small ways. I find it a valuable addition to my life, but not everyone will, and that’s fine. After all, as Apple says, its the most personal device they’ve ever made. 

What a great piece, a review after three months of daily usage is so valuable!
