If you would have asked me a few months ago to describe to content that is available on YouTube, my answer may have been the following: Animal video compilations, stupid amateur comedy show, beauty videos and children playing Minecraft.

My view on YouTube and the content totally changed after I started listening to the [Hello Internet Podcast](http://www.hellointernet.fm "Hello Internet"). The two hosts [CGP Grey](http://www.cgpgrey.com "CGP Grey") and [Brady ‘Bradly’ Haran](http://www.bradyharan.com "Brady 'Bradly' Haran") earn their living by producing YouTube content. The reason I started listening had nothing to do with their job, but more with the always funny and entertaining conversations between the two of them. To get more insight into the topics they were talking about I started to watch their videos. A whole new world of unbelievable smart people producing highly informative/scientific and also entertaining content opened in front of me. I quickly discovered more people and more channels to not run out of new videos to watch.

I will just highlight a few of my favourite channels that mark a good starting point to the big YouTube education world.

  * [CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey "CGPGrey"): Fast-paced videos about obscure topics like country border, elections and flags.
  * [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile "Numberphile"): Mathematicians explaining numbers and math.
  * [Objectivity](https://www.youtube.com/c/objectivityvideos "Objectivity"): Videos about cool objects and relicts that played a role in the history of science.
  * [SmarterEveryDay](https://www.youtube.com/SmarterEveryDay "SmarterEveryDay"): Destin explores the world using science, often with the help of slow-mo videos.
  * [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/veritasium "Veritasium"): Derek explains all kinds of science facts and uncovers general misconceptions.

The most watched videos are general a perfect way to get an understanding about the different channels. Have fun!
