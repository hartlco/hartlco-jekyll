[Json Snell](http://sixcolors.com):
>Today Apple [dropped Photos for Mac via a developer release](http://sixcolors.com/link/2015/02/photos-for-mac-coming-as-part-of-os-x-10103/), and some developers are reporting signs that Apple has built this new app using something called UXKit, which sits above the Mac’s familiar AppKit frameworks and strongly resembles UIKit on iOS.

I really, really hope UXKit is one of the big new announcements Apple will make at WWDC in 4 months! I plan to build a Mac App this year, maybe I can write it using a Framework that has a lot in common with UIKit.
