title: "Swifty APIs: NSUserDefaults - radex.io"

[Radek:](http://radex.io/)
>In [Swifty methods](http://radex.io/swift/methods/), I was arguing that we should resist the temptation to write Swift the way Objective-C used to be written. I argued that we should develop new approaches and conventions to designing interfaces, and that we should, once and for all, abolish Objective-C’s excessive verbosity. 
[...]</br>
And so I decided to start a series of articles called Swifty APIs, where I’m going to take some class or component from an Apple framework and show how I would design it with Swift in mind.</br>
Today, we’ll dissect NSUserDefaults and give it a little make-over. We’re going to make it less verbose, a bit cleaner, and more consistent with other classes. We’ll polish its rough edges and we’ll make use of Swift’s cool features along the way.

This post is a great example on how to rethink the use of a well-known Objective-C API in Swift. It really demonstrates the beauty of Swift and shows that a lot of the points of criticism are due to inexperience and will fade in the future.

 I'm looking forward to the next post of the series!
