Yesterday I picked up my new Apple Watch 38mm Series 3 non-LTE[^1].
Here in Berlin at the Apple Store, there was a surprising big queue outside for the new watches and phones.
This time I chose the silver aluminium model with the fog sport band. There are no real design differences to my old original Apple Watch Sport but the speed of the device is a game changer. Finally Apps open  fast and the UI is responsive.
I will continue wearing my watch for at least 22 hours a day and I hope this model will again last me for over 2 years.
