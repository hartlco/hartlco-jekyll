title: "The Talk Show - LIVE FROM WWDC 2015, WITH SPECIAL GUEST PHIL SCHILLER"
---
> Recorded in front of a live audience at Mezzanine in San Francisco, John Gruber is joined by Phil Schiller to discuss the news from WWDC: OS X 10.11 El Capitan, iOS 9, the new native app SDK for Apple Watch, Apple Music, and the 2004 American League Championship series.
