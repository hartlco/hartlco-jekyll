In June of this year I had the opportunity to fly out to California and attend Apple’s World Wide Developer Conference. Being in San Francisco at this time of the year was one of my dreams since I got my first iPod and my love for Apple products began.

The best part of attending WWDC is the experience of being part of the community. There are great events every day, you meet so many interesting people and personalities you only know from the internet world.

But there is nothing I can write here that has not already been said at least a dozen of times, so I’ll just log this for memories and attach a few images.
