A lot has changed for me in the last few months, so it&#8217;s time for an quick update:

I finished and submitted my Bachelors thesis in May<sup id="fnref-43-1"><a href="#fn-43-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. A few weeks later I received my final grade and my official degree. It took me quite some time to go through all online profiles and remove the &#8218;computer science student&#8216; part of it. At this point it was time to actively start looking for my first real job.

I only sent out applications for iOS positions and it worked out pretty well. I attended a few interviews and decided to join a young, but international software development consulting company. Everything there was more inviting, structured and appealing than the other companies, mainly startups, I also applied at. The interview processes were stressful, but also exciting. Thank god no one asked ridiculous googly questions.

The month between signing the final contract and my first day at work just flew by. The weather was beautiful and I spent a great time with my lovely girlfriend<sup id="fnref-43-2"><a href="#fn-43-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. It struck me that this was my last school and university-like summer break. It&#8217;s part of growing up, I guess.

The first work day was two weeks ago. I&#8217;m still in the warming up phase, but everything looks perfect.

I hope you enjoyed the update and I can bring myself to write a post here and there.

  The programming part of my thesis was written in Swift 1.2. So the whole part will be outdated in a few weeks with the release of Swift 2.0. Programming is crazy.&#160;<a href="#fnref-43-1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
