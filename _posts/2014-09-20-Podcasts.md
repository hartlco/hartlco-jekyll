Two years ago I started listening to podcasts. This was the time I got interested in iOS development and the whole community around Apple and the Mac. I started following a lot of the big names on Twitter and realized that the medium "Podcast" is actually used in this little corner of the internet. I knew what podcasts were and that they have been around for years but always thought they are just a graveyard/archive for classic radio shows. 

[Marco Arments](http://www.marco.org) and [Dan Benjamins](http://benjamin.org/dan/) [Build & Analyze](http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze) was the first one I subscribed to and after that it piled up quickly. This medium fit right into my life because it can be consumed while I'm doing something else like cooking, shopping for groceries or cleaning the dishes. It makes boring tasks more pleasant and informative.

My iPhone is the only device I’m using to manage, download and play the actual podcasts. I’m a huge fan of [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/), but [Castro](http://castro.fm) and most of the other Apps in the Appstore are solid alternatives. iOS8 even comes with an App called “Podcasts.app”. If you are looking for some shows, here are the ones I’m subscribed to:

- [Accidental Tech Podcast](http://atp.fm)
- [Analog(ue)](http://relay.fm/analogue)
- [Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w)
- [Bionic](http://5by5.tv/bionic): The show is retired but I’m listening to old episodes from time to time. Just insane stuff.
