title: "Link: Objc.io Issue #16: Swift"
---
24 hours after the big September 2014 Keynote. We’re now living in a world where the new iPhones have a 4.7 and 5.5 screen and the rumors about the Apple wearable are no longer rumors.

But now it’s also possible to submit Apps written in Swift to the App Store. With this in mind, the awesome people over at [Objc.io](http://objc.io) released a new [issue](http://www.objc.io/issue-16/) of their so-called “periodical about best practices and advanced techniques for iOS and OS X development”. It’s all about Swift. Go read this and every issue before, it´s totally worth it.
