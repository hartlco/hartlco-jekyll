English is the international language in computer science and tech and in general. It&#8217;s perfectly suited for texts on those topics and creates a common ground for everyone. But as you probably can tell, it isn&#8217;t my first language, it is German. Over the past few weeks I more and more want to start writing in German. This has mainly two reasons:

All tech sites and personal blogs I&#8217;m reading are written in English, so there must be room for German posts. I don&#8217;t want to land on #1 on Hacker News, rather write something interesting and unique a few find interesting. German may be a small enough niche for this.

The second reason for writing in German is that I want to start writing more about my life in general. I think it will be easier for me to articulate my thoughts and stories in German and it will not hinder me on posting more often.

I really hope this plays out well, stay tuned!
