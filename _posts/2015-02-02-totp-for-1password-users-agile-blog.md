>1Password 5.2 for iOS and 1Password 4.1.0.538 for Windows are out, and they provide support for using Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTP) in your Logins (note: in iOS, itâ€™s part of our Pro Features). Note that this is not for unlocking 1Password itself, but to aid with logging into sites for which you may be using TOTP, such a Dropbox and Tumblr.

It's great seeing One Time Passwords integrated 1Password. It eliminates the need for another App, which I never fully trusted. The discussion about the whole subject in this post is also worth a read.
