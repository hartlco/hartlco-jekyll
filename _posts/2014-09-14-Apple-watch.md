Most of my life I was not a watch wearer. Two years ago, my lovely girlfriend gifted me a vintage Casio watch and now I'm constantly wearing it. It’s lightweight, does one thing extremely well and I never even thought about charging or changing the battery. 

All those points are not valid for the Apple Watch introduced in this week’s Apple Keynote. It does not look lightweight, slim or comfortable to wear. They showed off how to charge the device easily but didn’t say a word about the battery life, what probably means: You are going to charge it every night. It seems like it’s a pretty great fitness tracker, but also a notification center, a messenger,… . You got the feeling even Apple does not really know what it’s exactly for. Why would they show off the planetarium watch face and the ability to modify the face of emoticons when they have a clear vision for this product like they had with the iPhone? Developers will find a way to make something out of it.

I think Apple has a clear vision but is not able to execute them right now. They want a device that really is a part of you, tracks and measures everything you do, helps you with daily tasks like paying in the grocery store or controlling your environment with just a short interaction on you wrist. In the best case you actively use the watch a few seconds but it’s able to improve every aspect of your life. Maybe the watch we will see in the beginning of 2015 is that device, but in the Keynote it looked more like an improved version of the smartwatches from Samsung and Motorola that are on the market for quiet a time now and not the product of Apple’s dreams. They surely tried to do the best that they can with the technology available. Apple is really good in releasing a product to an almost established market and totally destroying the competition with it. They did this with the iPad. (By the way, why is everyone at Apple always talking about “iPad” and “iPhone” and never saying “the iPad and the iPhone”?) So I’m definitely excited about the first time I’ll see this product in real life but I’m more excited about the watch we will see in 2-3 years, when the technology may have caught up to Apple’s visions.

At the moment I think I'm not going the buy the Watch in 2015. But we will talk again when I've seen it at the Apple Store.
