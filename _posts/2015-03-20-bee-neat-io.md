>Simple. Fast. Native.  
Issue tracking made fun on your Mac.

I started using Github issues for a all projects I'm currently working on. Bugs, features and the code now live in the same place. Bee by [neat.io](http://www.neat.io) is a super useful App to work with Github issues native on your Mac. It also supports FogBugz and Jira. Try it out!
