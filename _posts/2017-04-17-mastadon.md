>Mastodon is a free, open-source social network. A decentralized alternative to commercial platforms, it avoids the risks of a single company monopolizing your communication. Pick a server that you trust â€” whichever you choose, you can interact with everyone else. Anyone can run their own Mastodon instance and participate in the social network seamlessly.

I'm now crossposting my micro blog entries to my [Mastadon profile](https://mastodon.social/@martin). Pefect time to be interested in micro blogging with Mastadon growing like crazy an [Micro.blog](http://micro.blog) around the corner.
