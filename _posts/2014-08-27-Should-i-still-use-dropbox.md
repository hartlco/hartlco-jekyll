title: "Should I still use Dropbox?"
date: 2014-08-27

I finally got to try Mailbox for Mac and it got me to use the App full-time on both, the Mac and iOS (E-Mail clients is a topic I’m incredibly angry and furious about, I think I have to explain my thoughts about this in another post). As we all know, Dropbox now owns Mailbox and this made me think, if it’s a good idea to use a product of a company, which is seemingly under extreme pressure.

In the past weeks a lot negative thoughts about Dropbox floated around. For some it’s way to expensive in comparison to the competition, for others it’ll be redundant with the release of iCloud Drive in OS X 10.10 and iOS 8. For me, all those points aren’t valid at the moment. I don’t see myself sending all my documents, images and encrypted passwords to Google or Microsoft, nor do I trust Apple to reliable sync these files between my devices and offer some kind of worst-case emergency backup. 

Within the next weeks I’m going to start writing on my bachelor’s thesis and I’m 100% certain I’ll put all relevant files into my Dropbox folder because for me, there is no alternative which offers the same and adds extra value. With today’s [annoucement](https://www.dropbox.com/pro)  Dropbox even offers competitive pricing in comparison to Google and Microsoft.

For me there is no reason to not use Dropbox or one of their spin-off products. I’m incredible happy with all of them!
