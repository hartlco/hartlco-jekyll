After the Golden Master release of Xcode 9, my whole Twitter timeline was full of bad jokes about the Xcode reliability and links to [isxcodestableyet.com](https://isxcodestableyet.com).
Iâ€™m using Xcode 9 since the first beta every day in my main job and it was the smoothest beta cycle I ever witnessed. Xcode 9 introduces so many great new features and I was incredibly happy to rename `Xcode` to `Xcode 8` and install the GM of Xcode 9!
