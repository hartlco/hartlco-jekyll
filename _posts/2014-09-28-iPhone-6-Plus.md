After Apple announced the new phones I constantly thought about the different sizes, the different use-cases and what phone I’m going to buy. This weekend I finally had the opportunity to see them in person. The iPhone 6 clearly feels like a great successor to the iPhone 5/5s. The increased screen real estate is nice but it doesn’t feel like a different form factor, thanks to it’s thinness. The rounded glass feels incredible and makes the swipe-back-gesture pleasant. The bulk out camera lens still isn’t the most beautiful thing, but it will be forgotten after a few hours of usage. With a case on it, it doesn’t even matter anymore.

The iPhone 6 Plus isn’t an obvious product to me. It doesn’t look as humongous in real life as expected. I can hold and use it with one hand and could probably fit it into my jeans pocket, even though I’m one of those persons wearing the skinny ones. The screen looks amazing and the additional space is very welcomed in Safari or in general landscape mode. The iPhone 6 Plus surely looks like a great reading device. But I can not figure out which problems it could solve for me. It can not replace an iPad: the screen feels too small to comfortably watch videos; I can’t use 4-6 fingers to type like I do with an iPad Mini. It can’t replace my Kindle either because a shiny screen, no matter what resolution it has, is exhausting for my eyes. In addition to this, the device feels contracted. The scaled down 3x resolution, a GPU barley capable of dealing with the amount of pixel. It feels a bit like the first generation iPad.  Apple has great plans for it, but isn’t ready for it. Maybe the iPhone 6 Plus will gain use-cases in the future, with optimised Apps and accessories. At the moment it isn’t for me.

I’m definitely getting an iPhone 6 in white. I’m not a fan of the new Space Grey, I liked the “stealth black” the iPhone 5 had. The new Gold looks a bit more pinky, too feminine for my taste. I’m excited!
