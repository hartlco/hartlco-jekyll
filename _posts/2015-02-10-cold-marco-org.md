[Marco Arment:](http://www.marco.org/2015/02/10/cold)

>Vaccines are truly one of humanity’s greatest and most important accomplishments.  
It’s tragic, dangerous, and incredibly destructive that society is needlessly regressing on this front. I’m sadly confident that anti-intellectualism and shunning of widely proven scientific data, selfishly and shamelessly encouraged by entertainers and politicians to advance their careers, will prove to be the most damaging and deadly regression of developed society in my lifetime.

This is one of my favourite pieces of the young year. I can not believe that anti-vaccination is still a thing in the year 2015. It's understandable that some people were sceptic about vaccines 100 years ago. Now, after millions (even billions doesn't sound too far off) of saved lives, there shouldn't be a discussion anymore. 

["I’m an Anti-Braker"](http://robertmoorejr.tumblr.com/post/110101466091/im-an-anti-braker) sums up the whole discussion in a nice satiric way.
