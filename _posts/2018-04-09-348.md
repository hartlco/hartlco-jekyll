I have finally reached a scroll performance for my micro.blog client that Iâ€™m happy with. Biggest bottlenecks were NSAttributedStrings rendered with TTTAttributedLabel (replaced by plain UILabel with custom link touch detection) and displaying big images in small UIImageViews (solved by resizing images in background thread and caching).
