>Sinatra and Node are very similar. But as awesome as Node is, it has one giant drawback: you have to write in JavaScript.<br>
...<br>
Ruby has a whole lot in common with Objective-C. Both languages count Smalltalk as an ancestor: both are object-oriented and both use dynamic dispatch. I think youâ€™d like it.

I love Ruby and Sinatra. It really feels a lot like Cocoa programming. 

I used Sinatra for my first web projects and was perfectly happy with it. This was the time when every post on Hackernews was about Node.js, so I got the feeling that the whole Ruby/Sinatra community is in decline. 

I tried Node.js for my next little projects, it worked but I wasn't really happy with it. Everything felt overwhelming and out of control (just look at all the packages express.js requires). 
I needed some time to realize that you should use what you really want to use and not what is the new hipness today because this will change tomorrow. 

I'm going to use Sinatra again, as long as there is no serverside Swift.
