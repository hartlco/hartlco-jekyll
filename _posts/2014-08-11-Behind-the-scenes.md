With today's release of [Ghost 0.5](http://blog.ghost.org/ghost-0-5/) it's a perfect moment to talk about the software and services I'm using to run this site.

## Content Management System

I'm using [Ghost](https://ghost.org). Not because I'm incredibly keen on using Javascript with Node.js but I can’t see a better alternative. Ghost is lightweight in comparison to Wordpress, heavily uses Markdown and I can publish on the go thanks to it's web interface. I'm not interested in writing and maintaining my own platform, so Ghost is ok for me.
I'm also watching the development of [Kirby](http://getkirby.com), maybe I will switch in the future, we will see.

## Theme

The theme is a fork of [Sven Read's](https://github.com/starburst1977) awesome [ReadiumTheme](https://github.com/starburst1977/readium).  It’s available on [Github](https://github.com/martinhartlorg/martinhartlorg-theme)

## Hosting

This site is hosted on [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de). Those guys offer an incredible service for a "pay-what-you-want" price point. All the administration is done via ssh and the command line. The nerd way of doing things.  The support is really helpful and fast. I can’t recommend them enough.

-- Update: This blog is now hosted on a Digital Ocean VPS - [read more here](http://martinhartl.org/digital-ocean/)

## Domain

[Hover](https://www.hover.com). Seamless, fast, no bullshit. If you are using a different registrar, do yourself a favor and try Hover. I love them.
