That's a super interesting post by Ariel Elkin. I really enjoyed the first half of the post, especially where he laid out the dangers of relying on a whole development environment that's built on top of another one. It somehow scares me that React Native is maintained by Facebook, whose business goals are not really linked to maintaining and improving it. We've been there before with Three20.

I didn't have that big of an interest in the second half as it mostly looks into weird JavaScript quirks. We all know that JavaScript isn't that great. Nevertheless, I recommend reading it.
