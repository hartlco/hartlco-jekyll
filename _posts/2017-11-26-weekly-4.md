As I spent the whole week at the pool, the beach, or near the [tallest building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burj_Khalifa) in the world, this Weekly will be the shortest so far.

### Reading
I finished reading Sleeping Giants. It was very light and easy too read. A Good choice for a vacation book when you want to turn off your head. For my taste, the science part was often glossed over. I had the feeling that understanding a base-8 number systems was the hardest problem the scientists had to solve.

For the rest, here are a few images from Dubai:

See you next week!
