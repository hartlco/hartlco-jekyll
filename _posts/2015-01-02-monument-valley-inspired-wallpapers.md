I was looking for new wallpapers for my Mac and my iPhone when I accidentally landed on the [Monument Valley](http://www.monumentvalleygame.com) website. [Monument Valley](http://www.monumentvalleygame.com) was my favourite game of 2014. I&#8217;m still in love with the very specific style and design. I immediately knew I wanted the background image of the site for my devices, but due to compression the gradients of the image didn&#8217;t look that great on retina devices.
  
So I fired up Sketch to creat a background in that style myself.
  
The result (includes resolutions for Mac, iPhone 5, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and the Sketch file) can be downloaded here:
