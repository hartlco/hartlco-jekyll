> Lore is a bi-weekly podcast about true life scary stories. The people, places, and things of our darkest nightmares all have real facts at their core. Each episode of Lore looks into a uniquely scary tale and uncovers the truth behind it. Sometimes the truth is more frightening than fiction.

I discovered this podcast just by accident and I loved every episode of it. It’s produced by the designer and author of supernatural thrillers [Aaron Mahnke][1]. He tells regional scary stories, the kind that would be told around a campfire. He explains the stories in the context of the time and draws lines to the present. This podcast isn’t about supernatural fanatics, it’s just about telling lore. Also the background music was on point for every episode.
