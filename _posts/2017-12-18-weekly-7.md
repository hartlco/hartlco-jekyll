Itâ€˜s getting clearer that busy weeks for me will correlate to shorter Weeklys...and this week was busy!

### Star Wars
Even though this week was exhausting, I managed to watch the new Star Wars movie two times this week. At 12 in the opening night and yesterday evening. Iâ€˜m still not sure how to feel about but Iâ€˜m looking forward to seeing it again, so thatâ€˜s a good sign at least. Star Wars and Christmas are merging more and more in my recent memory and thatâ€˜s a great thing. I hope it will continue for quite a while to have a new space opera a few days before the holidays.

### iMac Pro
The new iMac Pro looks really good. I canâ€˜t wait to see the black finish in a store. Itâ€˜s too bad that this device makes absolutely no sense for me to buy... or maybe not, at least I save thousands of Euros.

### Wrap-Up
Iâ€˜m trying to compile a â€žTopâ€œ list for this year. It will include movies, music, tech, games and, podcasts. It gets clearer to me that 2017 was a good year, at least for those categories.
