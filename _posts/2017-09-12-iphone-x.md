Today is the day of Apple‘s big iPhone Keynote. Thanks to unimaginable big software leaks from inside Apple, it feels like we already know everything about the new iPhone X. But I‘m still excited about the event. We know the features and hardware specifications but not know how the new hardware really works, how it will impact the way we use and handle this device, and more importantly, what it will enable us to do in the future.

The iPhone nowadays is my main computer, I use it for work, entertainment, communication and carry it all the time from the moment I leave my bed. I even just deployed this new site using Transmit for iOS on my phone.

I can‘t wait for the event today, to learn about the future of the iPhone in a big, complete picture and no longer try to reason about scattered, small pieces that were leaked over the last weeks!
