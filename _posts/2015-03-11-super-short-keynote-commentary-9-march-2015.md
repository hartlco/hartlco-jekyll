title: "Super short keynote commentary - 9 March 2015"
date: 2015-03-11

I finally found some time to watch the Keynote. Because there is never enough commentary about Apple Keynotes, here is my super short one.

- Apple TV: I hope they lowered the price to make room for a new model!
- ResearchKit: I really love what  Tim's Apple is doing in the medical field. Just great.
- The new MacBook: This is the future of the notebook and reasonable priced for a first generation. Right now it's constrained but it will be an awesome device in 2 years.
- Watch: Apple found it's vision for the Watch. It's a contrast to the revealing of the Watch 6 months ago. The pricing isn't surprising, but I don't see a future for the Apple Watch Edition.
