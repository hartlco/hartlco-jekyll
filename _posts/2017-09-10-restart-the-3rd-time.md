**Update** December 2017: I moved back to my old Jekyll system. I slowly migrate all the old existing micro posts to [micro.hartl.co](https://micro.hartl.co).

I want to give this site/blog yet another restart. All recent post I have published here were microblog posts. I hoped it would give this site more activity and content. In the end it destroyed the structure of the site and made it less appealing for me to work on it. Also the move to Jekyll maybe wasn’t the best decision. Especially when writing with an iPad, a web interface is very useful. I was able to publish on the go, but editing and making bigger changes was very uncomfortable with all the workflows and hacks.

I’m now giving [Kirby](https://getkirby.com/) a test run. Even though it’s PHP, the structure of the whole CMS is very simple and it’s completely database-free!

All posts are still accessibly using the direct links and I’ll slowly migrate only the necessary posts to the new system. While doing this I’m also translating the German ones to English!

I plan to do more personal entries, no more micro blogposts and every now and the some technology commentary.
